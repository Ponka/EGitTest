This is Ponka's way of using Eclipse with github.com.

1) Install Eclipse.
2) Run Eclipse and go to Help->Install New Software
3) Press 'Add' button
4) Type in 'git' as a name and 'http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno' as a location
5) Now you can 'work with' added 'git' plugins collections
6) Select 'collaboration'
7) Press 'next' button and do whatever needed
8) When installed you can use it by right-clicking on the project and selecting 'Team'->'remote'->'push'
